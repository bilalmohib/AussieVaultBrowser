## üîê Step 2: Set Up 1Password Connect

### 2.1 What is 1Password Connect?

1Password Connect is a secure API server that allows applications to access your 1Password vaults without user interaction. This is what enables automatic SharePoint login.

### 2.2 Deploy 1Password Connect (Easiest Method)

**Option A: Using Docker (Recommended)**

1. **Install Docker Desktop:**
   - Go to: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
   - Download and install for your operating system
   - Start Docker Desktop

2. **Create 1Password Connect credentials:**
   - Log into your 1Password Business account
   - Go to **"Integrations"** ‚Üí **"1Password Connect"**
   - Click **"Deploy 1Password Connect"**
   - Choose **"Download credentials file"**
   - Save the file as `1password-credentials.json`

3. **Create a folder for 1Password Connect:**
   ```bash
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   mkdir C:\1password-connect
   cd C:\1password-connect
   
   # On Mac/Linux
   mkdir ~/1password-connect
   cd ~/1password-connect
   ```

4. **Copy the credentials file:**
   - Move `1password-credentials.json` to the folder you just created

5. **Run 1Password Connect:**
   ```bash
   # Run this command in PowerShell/Terminal
   docker run -d \
     --name onepassword-connect \
     -p 8080:8080 \
     -p 8443:8443 \
     -v ${PWD}/1password-credentials.json:/home/opuser/.op/1password-credentials.json \
     -v ${PWD}/data:/home/opuser/.op/data \
     1password/connect-api:latest
   ```

6. **Verify it's running:**
   ```bash
   # Check if container is running
   docker ps
   
   # You should see "onepassword-connect" in the list
   ```

7. **Test the connection:**
   - Open your browser
   - Go to: http://localhost:8080/health
   - You should see: `{"name":"1Password Connect API","version":"1.x.x"}`

**Option B: Using 1Password Connect Cloud (Alternative)**

1. **In your 1Password Business account:**
   - Go to **"Developer Tools"** ‚Üí **"1Password Connect"**
   - Choose **"Connect Cloud"** (hosted by 1Password)
   - **Note the Connect Host URL** provided (e.g., `https://your-instance.1password.com`)

---

## üîë Step 3: Create Service Account

### 3.1 Create Service Account for the Application

1. **In your 1Password Business account:**
   - Go to **"Service Accounts"** in the left menu
   - Click **"Create Service Account"**

2. **Fill in the details:**
   - **Name:** `SharePoint Secure Browser`
   - **Description:** `Service account for secure browser vault access`
   - **Vault Access:** Select "Specific vaults" (we'll create one next)

3. **Create the vault:**
   - Click **"Create new vault"**
   - **Vault name:** `SharePoint Secrets`
   - **Description:** `Secure storage for SharePoint credentials`
   - **Click "Create vault"**

4. **Set permissions:**
   - **Grant the service account "Read" access** to the `SharePoint Secrets` vault
   - **Click "Create Service Account"**

5. **IMPORTANT - Save your token:**
   - **Copy the service account token** (starts with `ops_`)
   - **Save it immediately** - you won't see it again!
   - Example: `ops_abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234`

---

## üìù Step 4: Store SharePoint Credentials

### 4.1 Create SharePoint Login Item

   - Log into: https://my.1password.com
   - Navigate to the **"SharePoint Secrets"** vault

2. **Create new login item:**
   - Click **"New Item"** ‚Üí **"Login"**

3. **Fill in basic information:**
   - **Title:** `SharePoint Service Account`
   - **Username:** `your-sharepoint-service@datalifesaver.onmicrosoft.com`
   - **Password:** `your-actual-sharepoint-password`

   - **Value:** `microsoft.com,office.com,msn.com,live.com`

4. **Add another text field:**
   - **Label:** `level3_enabled`
   - **Value:** `true`

5. **Save the item**

### 4.3 Get the Item ID

1. **Click on the "SharePoint Service Account" item** you just created
2. **Look at the browser URL** - it will look like:
   `https://my.1password.com/vaults/[vault-id]/items/[item-id]`
3. **Copy the item ID** (the part after `/items/`)
   - Example: `abc123def456ghi789`
4. **Save this ID** - you'll need it for your `.env` file

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Configure Your Application

### 5.1 Install 1Password CLI (Optional but Helpful)

**Windows:**
1. Go to: https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/
2. Download the Windows installer
3. Run the installer

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install --cask 1password-cli
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -sS https://downloads.1password.com/linux/keys/1password.asc | gpg --dearmor --output /usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/1password-archive-keyring.gpg] https://downloads.1password.com/linux/debian/$(dpkg --print-architecture) stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/1password.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install 1password-cli
```

### 5.2 Test Your Setup (Optional)

**If you installed the CLI, test your connection:**

```bash
# Set environment variables (replace with your actual values)
export OP_CONNECT_HOST=http://localhost:8080
export OP_CONNECT_TOKEN=ops_abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234

# Test connection
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OP_CONNECT_TOKEN" \
     "$OP_CONNECT_HOST/v1/health"

# Should return: {"name":"1Password Connect API","version":"1.x.x"}

# Test getting your item (replace with your actual item ID)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OP_CONNECT_TOKEN" \
     "$OP_CONNECT_HOST/v1/items/abc123def456ghi789"

# Should return JSON with your SharePoint credentials
```

# üîí Secure Remote Browser Platform

A secure, VPN-routed desktop application built with Electron and React for accessing SharePoint documents through a controlled browser environment.

## üìã Overview

This application provides secure remote access to SharePoint-hosted documents with the following key features:

- **üåê Australian VPN Routing**: All browser traffic routed through Australian VPN endpoints
- **üîë Vault-Managed Credentials**: Shared SharePoint credentials securely managed via vault services
- **üìÑ View-Only File Access**: Documents viewed in-browser only, never downloaded locally
- **üõ°Ô∏è Role-Based Access Control**: Three access levels with different browsing permissions
- **‚ö° Fail-Closed Security**: Browser access blocked if VPN connection fails

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

- **Electron Main Process**: Security enforcement, VPN integration, vault communication
- **React Frontend**: User interface, browser controls, authentication
- **Webview Security**: Sandboxed browsing with credential injection
- **Vault Integration**: Secure credential storage and rotation
- **VPN Management**: Australian endpoint connection and monitoring

### Access Levels

| Level | Description | Allowed Domains | SharePoint Access |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **1** | Restricted | SharePoint, Office365 only | ‚úÖ View-only |
| **2** | Manager | SharePoint + Whitelisted domains | ‚úÖ View-only |
| **3** | Full Access | All domains (VPN-routed) | ‚úÖ View-only |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- Australian VPN service account (NordLayer/ExpressVPN/WireGuard)
- Vault service (HashiCorp Vault/AWS Secrets Manager/Azure KeyVault)
- SharePoint tenant access

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd secure-remote-browser

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# VPN Configuration
VPN_PROVIDER=nordlayer              # nordlayer | expressvpn | wireguard
VPN_ENDPOINT=au-sydney-01.vpn.com   # Australian VPN endpoint
VPN_API_KEY=your-vpn-api-key       # VPN service API key

VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.company.com # Vault service URL
VAULT_ROLE_ID=your-role-id          # Vault authentication
VAULT_SECRET_ID=your-secret-id      # Vault authentication

# SharePoint Configuration
SHAREPOINT_TENANT=company.sharepoint.com
SHAREPOINT_LIBRARY=/sites/documents/Shared Documents

# Application Settings
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Running the Application

```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production build
npm start
```

## üîß Configuration

### VPN Provider Setup

#### Option 1: NordLayer (Recommended for Enterprise)
```typescript
// Provides enterprise-grade security with Australian endpoints
vpn: {
  provider: 'nordlayer',
  australianEndpoints: [
    'au-sydney-01.nordlayer.com',
    'au-melbourne-01.nordlayer.com'
  ],
  features: ['enterprise-grade', 'api-integration', 'fail-safe']
}
```

#### Option 2: ExpressVPN (Reliable Alternative)
```typescript
vpn: {
  provider: 'expressvpn', 
  australianEndpoints: [
    'australia-sydney.expressvpn.com',
    'australia-melbourne.expressvpn.com'
  ],
  features: ['high-speed', 'reliable', 'automation-friendly']
}
```

#### Option 3: WireGuard + Australian VPS (Cost-Effective)
```typescript
vpn: {
  provider: 'wireguard',
  australianEndpoints: ['au-syd-wg.yourdomain.com'],
  features: ['full-control', 'cost-effective', 'high-performance']
}
```

### Vault Provider Setup

#### HashiCorp Vault (Recommended)
```bash
# Enable AppRole authentication
vault auth enable approle

# Create policy for SharePoint secrets
vault policy write sharepoint-policy - <<EOF
path "secret/data/sharepoint" {
  capabilities = ["read"]
}
path "secret/data/sharepoint-config" {
  capabilities = ["read"]  
}
EOF

# Create role
vault write auth/approle/role/secure-browser \
    token_policies="sharepoint-policy" \
    token_ttl=1h \
    token_max_ttl=4h
```

#### Store SharePoint Credentials
```bash
# Store shared SharePoint credentials
vault kv put secret/sharepoint \
    username="sharepoint-service@company.com" \
    password="secure-password-from-vault"

# Store SharePoint configuration
vault kv put secret/sharepoint-config \
    tenantUrl="https://company.sharepoint.com" \
    libraryPath="/sites/documents/Shared Documents" \
    allowedFileTypes="pdf,docx,xlsx,pptx"
```

  ipAddress: "203.219.252.100",
  latency: 45
}
```

### Security Logging

  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${VPN_API_KEY}"

# Test Australian IP
curl https://ipapi.co/json
```

### Vault Access Issues  
```bash
# Test vault connectivity
vault status

# Verify credentials
vault kv get secret/sharepoint
```

### SharePoint Access Issues
- Verify tenant URL in configuration
- Check shared credentials in vault
- Confirm library permissions
- Test SharePoint URL manually

## üìû Support & Configuration

For VPN and Vault provider recommendations based on your infrastructure:

- **Enterprise Setup**: HashiCorp Vault + NordLayer
- **AWS Native**: AWS Secrets Manager + ExpressVPN  
- **Cost-Effective**: Custom Vault + WireGuard
- **Azure Native**: Azure KeyVault + ExpressVPN
